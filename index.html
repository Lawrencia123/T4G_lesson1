  <h1>Never judge a book by its cover</h1>
  <h2>One has to learn to be content with himself or herself.</h2>
  
<p>There is always going to be something unique about yourself 
    that the person you may be envying may not have. <br>
Just love yourself regardless and be comfortable and content.</p>
